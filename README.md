# ICY_Durham
Post-processing of the critical current data taken at Durham.
The data was taken by applying varying magnetic field strengths at different angles to a strip of ReBCO supconductor tape and measuring the voltage across the sample at different applied currents. 
We expect to see that the crictical current decreases at higher magnetic fields (the superconductor performs worse) and that the performance of a superconductor peaks when the magnetic field is applied perpendicular (at 90 degrees) to the sample.
